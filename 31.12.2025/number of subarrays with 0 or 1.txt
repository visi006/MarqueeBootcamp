You are given an array/list consisting of 0 and 1 only. Your task is to find the sum of the number of subarrays that contains only 1 and the number of subarrays that contains only 0.
An array 'C' is a subarray of array 'D' if 'C' can be obtained from 'D' by deletion of several elements from the beginning and several elements from the end. Example :
Let 'ARR' = [1,0,0] then the possible subarrays of 'ARR' will be: {1}, {0}, {0}, {1,0}, {0,0}, {1,0,0}.
Example
If the given array 'ARR' = [1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Then the number of 1’s subarrays will be 5. [{1},{1},{1},{1,1},{1}]
And the number of 0’s subarrays will be 7. [{0},{0},{0},{0,0},{0,0},{0,0,0},{0}]
So our answer will be 5 + 7 = 12.
